## Overview

Welcome to the **JioLiv Real Estate Investment Plan** repository! This project is dedicated to the NeoLiv platform, an innovative real estate investment vehicle designed to provide secure, high-return opportunities in India's booming residential property market. Founded by Rohit Malhotra (former MD & CEO of Godrej Properties), NeoLiv integrates fund management, property development, and tech-enabled solutions to deliver premium residential projects with strong ROI potential.

NeoLiv focuses on high-growth markets like Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), Delhi-NCR, and emerging hotspots such as Alibaug and Sonepat. Backed by SEBI-registered Category II Alternative Investment Fund (AIF) – **Jioliv Real Estate Fund** – and strategic partners like 360 ONE, this plan offers investors a transparent, efficient way to participate in plotted developments, mid-income high-rises, luxury apartments, villas, and mixed-use townships.

### Key Highlights
- **Target Corpus**: ₹1,000–1,500 crore for the maiden fund, with initial closing of ₹300 crore achieved in March 2024.
- **Investment Focus**: Equity-based funding for land acquisition and development in plotted and residential projects.
- **Expected Returns**: Above debt fund benchmarks (16–18%), starting from Year 2, driven by in-house development capabilities.
- **Investor Base**: Primarily family offices and UHNI (Ultra High Net Worth Individuals) seeking diversified real estate exposure.

- **Diversified Portfolio**: Mix of premium residential developments, including:
  - Plotted developments and villas in Alibaug and Sonepat.
  - Mid-income high-rises and luxury townships in Khopoli and Delhi-NCR.
- **Tech-Enabled Platform**: Virtual site visits, digital documentation, and seamless transaction processes for a transparent investor experience.
