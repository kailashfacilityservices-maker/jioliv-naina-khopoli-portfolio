# JioLiv Real Estate Investment Plan

## Overview

Welcome to the **JioLiv Real Estate Investment Plan** repository! This project is dedicated to the **JioLiv** platform — an innovative real estate investment vehicle designed to provide secure, high-return opportunities in India's booming residential property market.  

Founded by **Rohit Malhotra** (former MD & CEO of Godrej Properties), **JioLiv** integrates fund management, property development, and tech-enabled solutions to deliver premium residential projects with strong ROI potential.

JioLiv focuses on high-growth markets like **Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR)**, **Delhi-NCR**, and emerging hotspots such as **Alibaug**, **Sonepat**, **Khopoli**, and **Naina**. Backed by a **SEBI-registered Category II Alternative Investment Fund (AIF)** – **JioLiv Real Estate Fund** – and strategic partners like **360 ONE**, this plan offers investors a transparent, efficient way to participate in plotted developments, mid-income high-rises, luxury apartments, villas, and mixed-use townships.

### Key Highlights
- **Target Corpus**: ₹1,000–1,500 crore for the maiden fund, with initial closing of ₹300 crore achieved in March 2024.
- **Investment Focus**: Equity-based funding for land acquisition and development in plotted and residential projects.
- **Expected Returns**: Above debt fund benchmarks (**16–18%**), starting from Year 2, driven by in-house development capabilities.
- **Investor Base**: Primarily family offices and **UHNI (Ultra High Net Worth Individuals)** seeking diversified real estate exposure.

## Features of the Investment Plan

- **High-Growth Locations**: Strategic investments in infrastructure-boosted areas (e.g., near **Mumbai Trans Harbour Link**, **Navi Mumbai International Airport**, **Mumbai-Pune Expressway**, and **NAINA City**).
- **Diversified Portfolio**: Mix of premium residential developments, including:
  - Plotted developments and villas in **Alibaug** and **Sonepat**.
  - Mid-income high-rises and luxury townships in **Khopoli** and **Delhi-NCR**.
  - Integrated township opportunities in **NAINA (Navi Mumbai Airport Influence Notified Area)**.
- **Tech-Enabled Platform**: Virtual site visits, digital documentation, and seamless transaction processes for a transparent investor experience.
- **Sustainability & Innovation**: Projects emphasize modern design, world-class amenities, and eco-friendly practices to maximize long-term value.
